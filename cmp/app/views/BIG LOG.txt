# BUG LOG #

## Compilation error due to the encoding problem
### DATE
    2017/6/18 
### LOCATION:
	all template files
### DETAILS:
    the compiler raised "not found value 'page'", which is the argument of template's peremeter, and is written in right syntax.
### REASON:
    the encoding of files is UTF-8(with BOM), which cannot be dealed with correctly by the play compiler(I can say that is a bug of the compiler itself). the error prompt show on the brower did not display any giberrish, but at the bash window, I saw a redundant question mark is appended at the beginning of the file, right before "@(page..."
### SOLUTION:
    change encoding from UTF-8(with BOM) to UTF-8(without BOM)
